## Course description

Writing is part of every design project—from jotting down notes and questions to summarizing research, instructing users, and presenting work in proposals and marketing pages. In this course, we’ll examine the writing process, collaborate on long and short-form pieces, practice editing, and use language as a strategic tool in the design process.

This course focuses on clarity of ideas, structure, and style over grammar and mechanics.

## Course objectives

* Investigate how writing shapes and contributes to the design process
* Practice writing and editing collaboratively
* Develop and structure various kinds of text
* Use writing exercises to prepare for your thesis and process book

## Course requirements

We will practice thinking and writing—together and individually—through conversation, writing exercises, and peer editing. Be prepared to:

* Ask questions, take risks, and express yourself
* Share rough ideas and unpolished drafts with the class
* Give candid, considered, and supportive feedback
* Grapple with the subjectivity of language

## Required text

[Several Short Sentences About Writing](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/93789/several-short-sentences-about-writing-by-verlyn-klinkenborg/9780307279415/), Verlyn Klinkenborg

## Grading and policies

Grading is [pass/fail](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/wiki/pmwiki.php/Site/GradingCriteria) and will be based on your attendance and participation in class. Please be on time and be prepared to discuss the reading assignments each week.

As this course is only five sessions, it’s important for you to be present and open to contributing to the conversation. More than two unexcused absences constitutes a failing grade.

If you will be late or need to miss a class, reach out to me in advance so you can keep with the assignments. No late work will be accepted.
