title: Week 5 - Presentations
---

This week, I asked the students to print three copies of their final, get into groups of three, read together, and critique each other’s writing. I was getting over a cold, so I tried to do as little talking as possible.

Afterwards, [Tina Lee](http://www.yonderother.co/) joined us for the final presentations. A few folks volunteered to read, and we went around the circle listening to each other, and commenting from time to time. I asked the students to take one more pass at their final drafts before turning them into me.

And just like that, the class is over. I always wish I had a few more weeks with the students, but it is what it is. Now they’re off to summer internships or overdue vacations, and I’m off to bed. <3
