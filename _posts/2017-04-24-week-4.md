## Materials

* [Slides](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/tree/master/_slides)
* [Notes](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/_notes/week-4.md)
* [Syllabus with readings for next week](http://strategicwriting.club/syllabus/#schedule)

## Warm-up exercise

Think back to the day you applied to SVA.

What have you learned since then?  
... about design?  
... about yourself?

Write a letter to your younger self. Go for 10 minutes.

## Guest lecture

Karyn talked about her work on [Etsy Studio](https://www.etsystudio.com), shared stories about how she got into design, and went around the room to see what questions the students had. See the [class notes](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/_notes/week-4.md) for details.

## Workshop

After Karyn left, the students paired up to talk about where they are in the writing process, and to get feedback from their peers.
