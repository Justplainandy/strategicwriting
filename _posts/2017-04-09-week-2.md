title: Week 2 - Voice and tone
---

This week, we talked about the differences between voice and tone, heard about the history of MyTransHealth from [Robyn Kanner](http://robynkanner.com/), and spent time editing each other’s work.

## Materials

* [Slides](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/tree/master/_slides)
* [Notes](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/_notes/week-2.md)
* [Syllabus with readings for next week](http://strategicwriting.club/syllabus/#schedule)

## Warm-up exercise

Set a timer. Go for 7 minutes.

## Voice and tone basics

Most of this is straight out of my book—with a whole lot of credit to my coauthor, Kate Kiefer Lee. I highly recommend checking out her work for MailChimp too:

* [Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com)
* [MailChimp Content Style Guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com)

## Editing

I say a lot more about editing in the second to last chapter of [Nicely Said](http://nicelysaid.co), but if you’re really curious about editing, I recommend reading [The Subversive Copy Editor](http://www.amazon.com/The-Subversive-Copy-Editor-Relationships/dp/0226734250/).

On Tuesday, we’ll write some [glimmers](http://strategicwriting.club), talk about structuring longer pieces, and spend time working on final projects.
