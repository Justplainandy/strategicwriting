title: Week 2 - Voice and tone
---

This week, we talked about the differences between voice and tone, heard about the history of MyTransHealth from [Robyn Kanner](http://robynkanner.com/), and spent time editing each other’s work.

## Materials

* [Slides](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/tree/master/_slides)
* [Notes](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/_notes/week-2.md)
* [Syllabus with readings for next week](http://strategicwriting.club/syllabus/#schedule)

## Warm-up exercise

Imagine you’re hosting an event.

How would you invite:

* a friend or peer?
* a grandparent or older family member?
* a famous artist, designer, or author?

Set a timer. Go for 7 minutes.

* * *

The exercise demonstrates how you naturally shift your tone to suit the situation. These invitations all sound like they came from you (they’re in your voice), but the tone shifts depending on what’s appropriate for the reader.

## Voice and tone basics

Most of this is straight out of my book—with a whole lot of credit to my coauthor, Kate Kiefer Lee. I recommend checking out her work for MailChimp, too:

* [Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com)
* [MailChimp Content Style Guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com)

## Editing

I say a lot more about editing in the second to last chapter of [Nicely Said](http://nicelysaid.co), but if you’re really curious about editing, I recommend reading [The Subversive Copy Editor](http://www.amazon.com/The-Subversive-Copy-Editor-Relationships/dp/0226734250/).

On Tuesday, we’ll write some [glimmers](http://strategicwriting.club), talk about structuring longer pieces, and spend time working on final projects.
