title: Week 2 - Voice and tone
---

This week, we talked about the differences between voice and tone and spent time editing each other’s work. [Robyn Kanner](http://robynkanner.com/) also joined us to talk about her work on [MyTransHealth](http://mytranshealth.com).

## Materials

* [Slides](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/tree/master/_slides)
* [Notes](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/_notes/week-2.md)
* [Syllabus with readings for next week](http://strategicwriting.club/syllabus/#schedule)

## Warm-up exercise

Imagine you’re hosting an event.

How would you invite:

* a friend or peer?
* a grandparent or older family member?
* a famous artist, designer, or author?

Set a timer. Go for 7 minutes.

* * *

The exercise demonstrates how you naturally shift your tone to suit the situation. These invitations all sound like they came from you (they’re in your voice), but the tone shifts depending on what’s appropriate for the reader.

## Storytelling exercise

Write about a time you did something out of character.

Go for 10 minutes.

## Voice and tone basics

> “Find the work that moves you the most deeply and read it over and over again.”—Cheryl Strayed

She emphasizes that to be a better writer, you have to read a lot, and study what you’re reading.

Your _voice_ is your personality. It doesn’t really change much from day to day.

Your _tone_ shifts to fit the situation and the reader’s mood. It’s how you show empathy. (It comes down to the words you choose (diction) and your inflection on the page.)

When I’m writing, I think about someone sitting next to me, and what I might say about them in person. It helps me imagine what they might be feeling as they’re going through a particular situation or flow on a website.

Consistency is less important than helping the user find what they need and showing you care.

Most of this section is straight out of my book—with thanks to my coauthor, Kate Kiefer Lee. I recommend checking out her work for MailChimp, too:

## Editing

We talk about editing in the second to last chapter of [Nicely Said](http://nicelysaid.co), but if you’re really curious about editing, I recommend reading [The Subversive Copy Editor](http://www.amazon.com/The-Subversive-Copy-Editor-Relationships/dp/0226734250/).
