I posted our class [syllabus](http://strategicwriting.club/syllabus/) today and updated the [readme file](https://github.com/nicoleslaw/strategicwriting/blob/master/README.md). Iâ€™m still thinking about our reading assignments, and looking forward to hearing about topics that interest you in our first class. Things may continue to shift before we meet.

Until then, happy writing and happy reading!
