## Course description
Writing is part of every design project—from jotting down notes and questions to summarizing research, instructing users, and presenting work in proposals and marketing pages. In this course, we’ll examine the writing process, collaborate on long and short-form pieces, practice editing, and use language as a tool in the design process.

This course focuses on clarity of ideas, structure, and style over grammar and mechanics.

## Course objectives

* Investigate how writing shapes and contributes to the design process
* Practice writing and editing collaboratively
* Develop and structure various kinds of text
* Use writing exercises to prepare for your thesis and process book

## Course requirements

We will practice thinking and writing—together and individually—through conversation, writing exercises, and peer editing.

Be prepared to:

* Ask questions, take risks, and express yourself
* Share rough ideas and unpolished drafts with the class
* Give candid, considered, and supportive feedback
* Grapple with the subjectivity of language

## Grading and policies

Grading is pass/fail and will be based on your participation and progress in class. Please be on time and be prepared to discuss the reading assignments each week.

As this course is only five sessions, it’s important for you to be present and contribute to the conversation. More than two unexcused absences and you risk failing the course. If you need to be absent for any reason, please give my instructor advanced notice so you can keep up with the assignments. No late work will be accepted.
